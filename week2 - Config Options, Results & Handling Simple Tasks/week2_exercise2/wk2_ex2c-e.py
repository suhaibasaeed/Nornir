"""
2c. Assign the results from "cisco3" to a new variable named "host_results".
Inspect this new MultiResult object: access the zeroith element from this MultiResult object.
Finally, determine if "host_results" is an iterable or not.

2d. Assign the zeroith element of the host_results object to a new variable named "task_result".
What type of object is task_result? Print out the 'host', 'name', 'result', and 'failed' attributes from task_result.
Which field actually contains the output from the network device?

2e. Looking back at exercises 2a - 2d: explain what Nornir result types are "my_results", "host_results", and "task_result"?
What purpose does each of those three data types serve (i.e. why do we have them)?
